 Machine-Learning Methods for Electricity Demand Forecasting (NAM and GAM)
The precise prediction of electricity demand is of critical significance for
energy providers as it is a crucial factor in their decision-making. The
increasing utilization of green energy sources underscores the need for
accurate forecasting of future electricity demand. In the field of forecasting,
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have proven to be a valuable tool in
overcoming the limitations of traditional statistical methods. Despite their
effectiveness, neural network methods can produce ambiguous predictions,
which may cause hesitation in their use for high-risk applications such as
electricity load forecasting.
To address this issue, the concept of Neural Additive Models (NAMs)
has been introduced. NAMs offer a clearer and more understandable model
by combining the versatility of DNNs with the inherent comprehension of
GAMs. Essentially, NAMs are models that learn a linear combination of
multiple neural networks, each designed to focus on a distinct
set of input features. Studies have demonstrated that these models perform
similarly to GAMs, but with the added advantage of using neural networks
as the underlying base, rather than boosted trees.
The primary objective of this thesis is the comparison of the performance
of NAMs with other machine learning techniques such as GAMs in the
context of load forecasting in electrical power systems. Both models are
known for being able to capture complex non-linear relationships between
predictive and target variables. The aim is to investigate their performance
and to compare their effectiveness in improving the accuracy of predictive
models for electricity demand, as well as to analyse the relative importance
of different features that influence the consumption of electricity.
This thesis will contribute to a better understanding of the potential
benefits and limitations of NAMs and GAMs in load forecasting by achieving
these objectives. The comparison between these two models will help to
identify their respective strengths and weaknesses. Ultimately, this will guide

the selection of the most appropriate method for improving the efficiency and
reliability of electricity demand forecasting in power systems.
